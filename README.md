# Cataloguer

NetrunnerDB's card search engine annoyed me, as it's syntax is often unintuitive (as a former mtg player who used scryfall a lot). Cataloguer aims to be as good as scryfall at searching for Netrunner cards. 

Cataloguer is written in the modern Rust web stack of axum-askama-htmx-tailwind, because Javascript is for web developers.

Currently still in development, with a beta release out on the website, currently focused on refactoring the backend to be prettier.

What this is / plans to be
- a versatile and powerful Netrunner card search engine
- a catalog of ALL printings of Netrunner cards, inlcuding official prize kits (and maybe some proxies with permission of their creators)
- easily integratable into NRO in the future

What this is not
- a replacement for all of nrdb, it's a neat website and deckbuilder
