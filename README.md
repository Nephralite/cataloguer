# cataloguer

NetrunnerDB is not as good a search engine as scryfall, and it's syntax is often unintuitive. Cataloguer aims to be as good as scryfall at searching for Netrunner cards. 

Cataloguer is written in the modern Rust web stack of axum-askama-htmx-tailwind, because Javascript is for web developers.

Status: Currently working towards a first beta release of v0.1.0 .
